# EA Smile 1 MT5

This code is for the EA Smile 1 MT5 trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The EA Smile 1 MT5 is designed to trade using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy. It uses the MovingAverages library to calculate the EMA values and the Trade library to execute trades.

## Strategy Parameters

The strategy parameters for the EMA strategy are defined as constants at the beginning of the code:

- `FAST_EMA_PERIOD`: The period for the fast EMA.
- `SLOW_EMA_PERIOD`: The period for the slow EMA.

## Stop Loss and Take Profit Levels

The stop loss and take profit levels for each trade are also defined as constants at the beginning of the code:

- `STOP_LOSS`: The stop loss level in pips.
- `TAKE_PROFIT`: The take profit level in pips.

## Trade and MovingAverages Instances

An instance of the Trade class and an instance of the MovingAverages class are created:

- `CTrade trade`: An instance of the Trade class to execute trades.
- `CMovingAverages movingAverages`: An instance of the MovingAverages class to calculate the EMA values.

## OnTick Function

The `OnTick` function is the main function that is called on each tick of the market. It performs the following steps:

1. Calculates the current EMA values for the fast and slow EMAs using the `iMA` function from the MovingAverages class.
2. Checks if there is a bullish trend (fast EMA > slow EMA). If true, it opens a long position using the `Buy` function from the Trade class.
3. Checks if there is a bearish trend (fast EMA < slow EMA). If true, it opens a short position using the `Sell` function from the Trade class.

## OnInit Function

The `OnInit` function is called when the program is initialized. It performs the following steps:

1. Enables automated trading by setting the expert magic number, stop loss, and take profit levels using the `SetExpertMagicNumber`, `SetExpertStopLoss`, and `SetExpertTakeProfit` functions from the Trade class.
2. Sets the EMA strategy parameters (fast and slow EMA periods) using the `SetFastEmaPeriod` and `SetSlowEmaPeriod` functions from the MovingAverages class.
3. Sets the symbol and lot size using the `SetSymbol` and `SetVolume` functions from the Trade class.
4. Subscribes to price updates for the specified symbol using the `SubscribeToQuotes` function from the Trade class.

## OnDeinit Function

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is deinitialized. It performs the following steps:

1. Unsubscribes from price updates for the specified symbol using the `UnsubscribeFromQuotes` function from the Trade class.
2. Closes all open positions using the `CloseAll` function from the Trade class.

## OnStart Function

The `OnStart` function is the main entry point of the program. It performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `OnInit` function to initialize the trading software.
2. Runs a loop until the program is stopped or terminated.
3. Calls the `OnTick` function for market analysis and trading.
4. Sleeps for a short period to avoid excessive CPU usage.
5. Calls the `OnDeinit` function to clean up and deinitialize the trading software.
